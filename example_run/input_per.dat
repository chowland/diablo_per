! Description
! For triply-periodic flows (NUM_PER_DIR=3):
! IC_TYPE specifies the functional form for the initial velocity
! KICK is a scale factor on the noise added when creating a new flow.
! BACKGROUND_GRAD(N) specifies if the scalar should be considered as a perturbation to a linear background gradient.
! This is designed to allow simulations of stratified flows in the triply periodic flow geometry.
