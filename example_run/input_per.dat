C Description
C For triply-periodic flows (NUM_PER_DIR=3):
C IC_TYPE specifies the functional form for the initial velocity
C KICK is a scale factor on the noise added when creating a new flow.
C BACKGROUND_GRAD(N) specifies if the scalar should be considered as a perturbation to a linear background gradient. This is designed to allow simulations of stratified flows in the triply periodic flow geometry.
